#parent process is the one which is primarily responsible for life of container


docker run -d --name neha alpine  ping fb.com    #ping fb.com will make the container in running state 
                            
# so here alpine parent process which is running we can now execute any other child process

docker exec neha date
#it will work becase alpine is running 

#now child container can be created when parent process is running
docker exec neha ping goggle.com
# now it will in running state even if we press ctrl+c

docker exec neha11 cal

#it will work

#now if a container is running then we can login # shell

docker exec -it neha sh             #it for intrective terminal

# here a shell is opened and we can work on it

docker kill neha
docker rm neha


#now see we can execute child while creating parent process


docker run -it --name neha1 apline sh  # so here we can execute whose chile processes which are present in image only
docker rm neha1

#for eg if we try to run 
docker run -it --name neha2 alpine ipcongig
# then it will show an error
